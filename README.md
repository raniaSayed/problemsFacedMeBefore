It's some problems faced me before &amp; was its solution

1- <h2>gitlab ssh problem (permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists.) </h2> 
<h3> Soltution:</h3> Wait for gitlab to send you an email that ssh is activated 
            Then check the permission of the folder you clone repo in it (don't chmod to 777 it's a big fault !! )
